  I decided to track how long it would take for the USPS to deliver mail accross the US.  I have enlisted the help of some friends and have rented 2 mailboxes to help track the delivery.  I am also using a friends virutal mailbox.  That is a total of 3 virutal mailboxes and 2 home addresses that I am sending letters to.  I am located in San Antonio Texas.  The locations I am sending letters to are San Antonio Texas, Phoenix Arizona, Walnut California, Gig Harbor Washington, and Kennebunk Maine. I decided to spread it out accross the US as much as possible.  The chart below shows the data in a graph format.  I send letters every morning before the postman gets here.  2 of the addresses I am sending to are friends houses, so I have asked them to check their mail at the same time everyday.  Both have chosen to check it at night.  The chart shows when the letter was sent, and how long it took to get there.  In order to track them I have written a Unique Identifier on the front of each envelope.  When the letter is received by one of my friends, they are taking a picture and sending it to me.  3 of the addresses are virtual mailboxes.  The way they work is that they send me a scan of the front of the envelope when they receive the mail.  By putting the Unique identifier on the front of the envelope I don't need to have the virtual mailbox service, or my friends, open the letter.
